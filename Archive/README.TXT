Description:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3D Mail Effects is a very unique email notification program/agent with as much
style as it has functionality. 3D Mail Effects is completely skinnable. When you
get new mail, you get a realistic, rotating 3D object that appears floating on
your desktop! Preview & delete emails without having to load your email program,
unlimited number of POP3 accounts (each individually configurable with their own
alarms, timers, etc.), hides nicely in the tray (blinks with new mail) and will
flash your keyboard LEDs so you can see when new mail has arrived without
turning on your monitor. 3D Mail Effects is completely configurable, not only
is the app skinned, but so are the 3D objects!
