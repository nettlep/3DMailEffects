<font size=4>Skins</font>
<ul>
	The majority of the documentation for skins is actually within the actual skin definition files. For
	a quick-start on skinning, simply locate the default skin directory (found within the 3DME installation
	directory) and load the file &quot;default.skin&quot; with any text editor (such as notepad.)
	<p>
	You'll find that the file is self documenting, with one exception: Buttons. Just about every version of
	3DME that's been released has had at least a few button additions. This does not mean that skins are not
	backward compatible. On the contrary, more buttons simply means more choices. There are far too many
	buttons for any one interface (well, you <i>could</i> create a single interface with all buttons present,
	but it would be rather cluttered.) Instead, the skin author has control over the interface (i.e. which
	parts of the interface are exposed to the users on the <a href="gui.html">main application window</a>.)
	<p>
	A quick note about backward compatibility: If a user running a newer version of 3DME loads a skin from
	an older version, the skin will act as normal. However, if the user is running an older version of 3DME
	than the skin was created for, then those buttons that were not available in the older version simply
	will not appear on the new interface. This may make some interfaces bare when used on older versions
	of 3DME. Fortunately, 3DME contains its own update notification, so hopefully, this will be of minimal
	importance.
	<p>
	All skin artists are requested (but not required) to include at least the five basic functionality
	buttons. They are:
	<p>
	<ul type=1>
		<li>Close
		<li>Hide
		<li>Context menu (a.k.a. &quot;Drop menu&auot;)
		<li>Mark read
		<li>Check for new mail now
	</ul>
	<p>
	As stated above, the default.skin file is self-documenting with the exception of buttons. This is because
	buttons will be added faster than that skin is updated. So be sure to look here for the latest list of
	buttons (note that their names are closely related to those functions found in the <a href="context.html">
	context menus</a>):
	<ul>
		<li>selectSkinButton
		<li>show3DButton
		<li>runEmailClientButton
		<li>showTipButton
		<li>showNewButton *
		<li>stayOnTopButton *
		<li>markReadButton
		<li>disableRemindersButton *
		<li>disableReminderRunsButton *
		<li>disablePopupsButton *
		<li>disable3DPopupsButton *
		<li>disableFlashingButton *
		<li>disableTrayBlinkingButton *
		<li>disableCheckingButton *
		<li>disableAlarmsButton *
		<li>disableAlarmRunsButton *
		<li>snapToDesktopEdgesButton *
		<li>aboutButton
		<li>checkNowButton
		<li>dropMenuButton
		<li>exitButton
		<li>helpButton
		<li>hideButton
		<li>stopPendingDeletesButton
		<p>
		[* = buttons with two states]
	</ul>
</ul>

<font size=4>Creating your own Models</font>
<ul>
	In order to create a 3D model for use in 3DME, you'll need to have access to a 3D modelling
	program that allows exporting to the traditional <b>3DS</b> (3D Studio R4) file format. If
	you're not familiar with this process, then you'll need to do a lot of reading and learning
	in order to get started.
	<p>
	For those of you who want to learn, visit the <a href="http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/index.html">
	MilkShape 3D home page.</a> MilkShape 3D is shareware (registration fee is US $20) that seems
	to be getting quite popular. On that site, you'll find tutorials on how to get started with
	MilkShape 3D, and a link that you can download a trial version.
</ul>

<font size=4>Creating your own Materials</font>
<ul>
	Creating materials is much simpler process. As an example, the majority of materials that shipped
	with 3DME only took about 10 minutes each. I also had a lot of fun creating them. All you need is
	a paint program. You will probably find Microsoft Paint already installed on your computer, or you
	can download one of many different programs, like <a href="http://www.jasc.com/product.asp?pf%5Fid=001">
	Paint Shop Pro</a>. Paint Shop Pro costs about $99, but you can download a trial version. Another alternative
	is <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The Gimp</a>, which is a free program, and quite powerful!
	<p>
	Once you've settled down with your favorite paint program, simply start creating BMP (Windows Bitmap) files
	that are exactly <b>256 pixels wide, by 256 pixels tall</b>. You may save your files in either 8-bit format
	or 24-bit format, but do not compress them, and do not use OS/2 format BMP files.
	<p>
	<b>Experiment!</b> -- try lots of things. I'm sure you'll find lots of interesting effects.
