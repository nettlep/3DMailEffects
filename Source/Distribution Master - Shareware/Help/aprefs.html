The Account Preferences dialog is for configuring each email of your email accounts.
<p>
One of the primary features of 3DME is the fact that it stores most of its configuration information
on a per-account basis. So, rather than configuring a single alarm sound for all new emails, you can
configure a different sound for each account. This is also true for reminder sounds, 'runs' (programs
that you want to run when new mail arrives or when a reminder sounds) and so on. There's quite a bit
to cover, so let's get started by taking a look at what this dialog looks like:
<p>
	<center><img src="img/aprefs.gif"></center>
<p>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>Name</b> -- Enter the name for this account. The name is used when displaying email
	on the <a href="gui.html">main application window</a>. Choose your name wisely so you can
	differentiate where each email arrived. For example, if you have an account &quot;paul@home.com&quot;
	and &quot;fred@home.com&quot; then you might use <i>paul</i> and <i>fred</i>. However,
	if you have two accounts &quot;paul@company.com&quot; and &quot;paul@home.com&quot;, then you
	might want to call your accounts <i>company</i> and <i>home</i>.
	<p>
	<li><b>Alarm &amp; program settings</b> -- Click this button to edit your <a href="alarms.html">alarm
	settings</a>. Alarms are ways to let you know that a new mail has just arrived. For example, you
	may want 3DME to display a <a href="3D.html">3D object</a> or play a sound when new mail arrives.
	You can also configure 3DME to start your default email client, or run some other program. Note
	that an alarm happens once per new mail arrival. Note that if you have this option enabled, yet
	you still do not hear any alarms, you may have them disabled in the <a href="toggles.html">context
	menu</a>.
	<p>
	<li><b>Reminder &amp; program settings</b> -- Click this button to edit your <a href="reminders.html">
	reminder settings</a>. Reminders are similar to alarms, except that they happen over and over again
	at a specified interval. For example, you may want 3DME to remind you every 15 minutes that new
	mail is waiting. A reminder will continue to sound until all the messages for the specified account
	have been marked as read (or deleted.) Note that if you have this option enabled, yet you still
	do not hear any reminders, you may have them disabled in the <a href="toggles.html">context menu</a>.
	<p>
	<li><b>This is a webmail account</b> -- Select this if the account is accessed via Webmail.
	See the section titled <a href="webmail.html">Webmail Scripts</a> for more information on what Webmail is and
	how it works in 3DME.
	<p>
	<li><b>Disable this account</b> -- If this option is enabled (with an X mark), this account will
	not appear in the <a href="gui.html">main application window</a>. It will not be checked for new
	mail, and it will be disabled in the <a href="toggles.html">context menu</a>. This is handy
	for accounts that are temporarily out of service or for those accounts you're only interested in
	monitoring periodically.
</ul>

	<p>
	<b>POP3</b>
	<p>

<ul>
	Note that these options will only be accessible if the option <u>This is a Webmail account</u> (see above) is
	<b>not selected</b>.
	<p>
	<li><b>POP3 server</b> -- This is where you enter your POP3 mail server. If you don't know
	what this is, you'll need to contact your ISP (or your email provider) and ask them. Very
	often (but not always) the mail server is &quot;mail.your_isp.com&quot;. For example, if your
	network service provider is &quot;foo.com&quot; then you might try &quot;mail.foo.com&quot;. If
	your ISP is &quot;foo.net&quot;, then try &quot;mail.foo.net&quot;. If this doesn't work, you
	can try a prefix of &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;pop3&quot;, as in &quot;pop.foo.com&quot; or
	&quot;pop3.foo.org&quot;. Also, if you use Microsoft Exchange, you can get your information from
	there by opening up Microsoft Exchange and clicking on the <i>Tools</i> menu, then clicking on
	<i>accounts</i>, then selecting the <i>Mail</i> tab, and hilighting your account in the list. Next,
	click <i>properties</i>, click the <i>Servers</i> tab. Finally, your mail server is the value
	in the field next to <i>Incoming mail (POP3)</i> -- simply enter that information <b>exactly as
	shown</b> into the <i>Mail server</i> field in 3DME. Please don't email support asking for this
	information, as we have no way of knowing what your ISP's mail server is.
	<p>
	<li><b>Port</b> -- You can usually leave this alone. The default port for POP3 email is 110. If
	this value needs to change, then there's a good chance you already know about it (i.e. you're
	an advanced user and you've purposely configured your pop3 server at a non-standard port.)
	<p>
	<li><b>Preview <u>???</u> lines of text per email</b> -- When 3DME checks for mail, it can grab
	a few lines from the top of the email, to allow you to preview it. The default is 5 lines, and
	may very well be too small for many users. For example, if somebody forwards you an email, very
	often, you'll see the forward &quot;header&quot; information (where the email came from, the
	subject, etc.) at the top of the email. With only 5 lines of preview text, you won't get any
	of the actual email, but rather, you'll see a portion of this forward header. If this happens
	often, simply increase this value. I tend to use 3DME to read all of my incoming email, so I
	keep my preview lines set to 999. However, if I get a large email (with an attachment) then it
	may take a little while to download those lines of text from the server.
	<p>
	<li><b>Only check for mail, don't retrieve anything</b> -- Similar to the preview line count, this
	causes 3DME to only get the list of emails, but not visit them. In effect, this results in much
	faster email checking, but your email list will not contian any information about the email, only
	that an email exists in this slot. The date assigned to the email, is the date of notification,
	not the date of delivery. The <i>subject</i> and <i>from</i> entries in the email list will read
	&quot;Not retrieved&quot;.
	<p>
	<ul>
		<b>Important note</b>: This also has an important side-effect. For users that are using 3DME to
		check for mail on their Microsoft Exchange server, this will prevent emails from being marked as
		'read' when your mail client eventually retrieves the emails from the server.
		<p>
		Unfortunately, due
		to the way that Microsoft Exchange Server works, there is no way to allow 3DME to preview an email
		(and/or retrieve the email header information) without marking those messages as read on the
		Exchange server.
	</ul>
</ul>

	<p>
	<b>Webmail</b>
	<p>

<ul>
	Note that these options will only be accessible if the option <u>This is a Webmail account</u> (see above) is
	<b>selected</b>.
	<p>
	<li><b>Webmail Script</b> -- Simply select your Webmail host from the list.
</ul>

	<p>
	<b>Server settings</b>
	<p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Username</b> -- Your email username is almost always the same username that you use
	when dialing into the internet, or logging on through your ISP. If you use Microsoft Exchange,
	It can also be found in the same location that your mail server was found.
	<p>
	<li><b>Password</b> -- Your email password is almost always the same password that you use
	when dialing into the internet, or logging on through your ISP. If you use Microsoft Exchange,
	It can also be found in the same location that your mail server was found, though you won't
	be able to read it (it will appear as a series of asterisks.)
	<p>
	<li><b>Check every <u>???</u> seconds</b> -- How often do you want 3DME to check for email on
	this account? 3DME will not let you enter a value less than 30 seconds, but there is no limit
	on the high-end of what this value can be. If you're on a slow dialup connection, it is advisable
	that you do not set this value too low, or it could potentially use up a lot of your bandwidth.
	<p>
	<li><b>Server timeout <u>???</u> seconds</b> -- It's usualy wise to leave this alone, unless
	you (1) know what you're doing, or (2) encounter a lot of timeout errors when 3DME is checking
	for email. If this happens, increase the value to 120 or even 300. If you wish to totally remove
	the timeout, enter 0.
