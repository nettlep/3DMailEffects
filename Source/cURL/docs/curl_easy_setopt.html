<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     curl_easy_setopt() is called to tell libcurl how  to  behave
     in a number of ways. Most operations in libcurl have default
     actions, and by using the appropriate options you  can  make
     them  behave  differently  (as documented).  All options are
     set with the <I>option</I> followed by a parameter. That  parameter
     can  be a long, a function pointer or an object pointer, all
     depending on what the option in question expects. Read  this
     manual  carefully  as  bad input values may cause libcurl to
     behave badly!  You can only set one option in each  function
     call.  A  typical  application  uses many curl_easy_setopt()
     calls in the setup phase.

     NOTE: strings passed to libcurl as 'char *' arguments,  will
     not  be  copied by the library. Instead you should keep them
     available until libcurl no longer needs them. Failing to  do
     so will cause very odd behaviour or even crashes.

     More note: the options set with this function call are valid
     for the forthcoming data transfers that are  performed  when
     you  invoke  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>perform</I> <I>.</I>  The options are not in any
     way reset between  transfers,  so  if  you  want  subsequent
     transfers  with  different  options,  you  must  change them
     between the transfers.

     The <I>handle</I> is the return code from the <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>init</I>  call.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     These  options are in a bit of random order, but you'll fig­
     ure it out!

     <B>CURLOPT_FILE</B>
             Data pointer to pass to file  write  function.  Note
             that if you specify the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>WRITEFUNCTION</I> , this
             is the pointer you'll get as input. If you don't use
             a  callback,  you  must  pass  a 'FILE *' as libcurl
             passes it to fwrite() when writing data.

             NOTE: If you're using libcurl as a  win32  DLL,  you
             MUST  use  the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>WRITEFUNCTION</I> if you set this
             option.

     <B>CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION</B>
             Function pointer that  should  match  the  following
             prototype:  <B>size_t</B> <B>function(</B> <B>void</B> <B>*ptr,</B> <B>size_t</B> <B>size,</B>
             <B>size_t</B> <B>nmemb,</B>  <B>void</B>  <B>*stream);</B>  This  function  gets
             called  by libcurl as soon as there is received data
             that needs to be written down. The size of the  data
             pointed  to  by  <I>ptr</I>  is <I>size</I> multiplied with <I>nmemb</I>.
             Return the  number  of  bytes  actually  written  or
             return  -1  to  signal error to the library (it will
             cause   it    to    abort    the    transfer    with
             CURLE_WRITE_ERROR).

             Set   the  <I>stream</I>  argument  with  the  <B>CURLOPT_FILE</B>
             option.

     <B>CURLOPT_INFILE</B>
             Data pointer to pass to the file read function. Note
             that  if  you specify the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>READFUNCTION</I>, this
             is the pointer you'll get as  input.  If  you  don't
             specify  a  read callback, this must be a valid FILE
             *.

             NOTE: If you're using libcurl as a  win32  DLL,  you
             MUST  use  a  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>READFUNCTION</I>  if  you set this
             option.

     <B>CURLOPT_READFUNCTION</B>
             Function pointer that  should  match  the  following
             prototype:  <B>size_t</B> <B>function(</B> <B>void</B> <B>*ptr,</B> <B>size_t</B> <B>size,</B>
             <B>size_t</B> <B>nmemb,</B>  <B>void</B>  <B>*stream);</B>  This  function  gets
             called  by  libcurl as soon as it needs to read data
             in order to send it  to  the  peer.  The  data  area
             pointed  at by the pointer <I>ptr</I> may be filled with at
             most <I>size</I> multiplied with  <I>nmemb</I>  number  of  bytes.
             Your function must return the actual number of bytes
             that you stored in that memory  area.  Returning  -1
             will  signal an error to the library and cause it to
             abort  the  current  transfer  immediately  (with  a
             CURLE_READ_ERROR return code).

     <B>CURLOPT_INFILESIZE</B>
             When  uploading a file to a remote site, this option
             should be used to tell  libcurl  what  the  expected
             size of the infile is.

     <B>CURLOPT_URL</B>
             The actual URL to deal with. The parameter should be
             a char * to a zero  terminated  string.  The  string
             must  remain  present until curl no longer needs it,
             as it doesn't copy the string. NOTE: this option  is
             required  to  be  set  before curl_easy_perform() is
             called.

     <B>CURLOPT_PROXY</B>
             If you need libcurl to use a http  proxy  to  access
             the  outside  world,  set the proxy string with this
             option. The parameter should be a char * to  a  zero
             terminated  string.  To  specify port number in this
             string, append :[port] to the end of the host  name.
             The  proxy string may be prefixed with [protocol]://
             since any such prefix will be ignored.

     <B>CURLOPT_PROXYPORT</B>
             Set this long with this option to set the proxy port
             to  use  unless  it is specified in the proxy string
             CURLOPT_PROXY.

     <B>CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL</B>
             Set the parameter to non-zero to get the library  to
             tunnel  all  non-HTTP  operations  through the given
             HTTP proxy. Do note that there is a  big  difference
             to  use  a  proxy  and  to tunnel through it. If you
             don't know what this means, you probably don't  want
             this tunnel option. (Added in libcurl 7.3)

     <B>CURLOPT_VERBOSE</B>
             Set  the parameter to non-zero to get the library to
             display a lot of verbose information about its oper­
             ations.  Very  useful  for  libcurl  and/or  protocl
             debugging and understanding.

     <B>CURLOPT_HEADER</B>
             A non-zero parameter tells the  library  to  include
             the  header in the output. This is only relevant for
             protocols that actually has a header preceeding  the
             data (like HTTP).

     <B>CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS</B>
             A  non-zero  parameter  tells the library to shut of
             the  built-in  progress  meter  completely.   (NOTE:
             future versions of the lib is likely to not have any
             built-in progress meter at all).

     <B>CURLOPT_NOBODY</B>
             A  non-zero  parameter  tells  the  library  to  not
             include  the  body-part  in the output. This is only
             relevant for protocols that have a  separate  header
             and body part.

     <B>CURLOPT_FAILONERROR</B>
             A  non-zero  parameter  tells  the  library  to fail
             silently if the  HTTP  code  returned  is  equal  or
             larger  than  300.  The  default  action would be to
             return the page normally, ignoring that code.

     <B>CURLOPT_UPLOAD</B>
             A non-zero parameter tells the  library  to  prepare
             for   an   upload.   The   CURLOPT_INFILE  and  CUR­
             LOPT_INFILESIZE are also interesting for uploads.

     <B>CURLOPT_POST</B>
             A non-zero parameter tells the library to do a regu­
             lar  HTTP  post. This is a normal application/x-www-
             form-urlencoded kind, which  is  the  most  commonly
             used  one  by HTML forms. See the CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS
             option for how to specify the data to post and  CUR­
             LOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE  in  how  to  set  the data size.
             Starting with libcurl 7.8, this option is  obsolete.
             Using  the CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS option will imply this
             option.

     <B>CURLOPT_FTPLISTONLY</B>
             A non-zero parameter tells the library to just  list
             the  names  of  an ftp directory, instead of doing a
             full directory listin that would include file sizes,
             dates etc.

     <B>CURLOPT_FTPAPPEND</B>
             A  non-zero parameter tells the library to append to
             the remote file instead of  overwrite  it.  This  is
             only useful when uploading to a ftp site.

     <B>CURLOPT_NETRC</B>
             A  non-zero parameter tells the library to scan your
             <I>~/.netrc</I> file to find user name and password for the
             remote  site  you  are about to access. Do note that
             curl does not verify that the file has  the  correct
             properties  set  (as  the  standard  unix ftp client
             does), and that only machine  name,  user  name  and
             password is taken into account (init macros and sim­
             ilar things aren't supported).

     <B>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION</B>
             A non-zero parameter tells the library to follow any
             Location:  header that the server sends as part of a
             HTTP header. NOTE that this means that  the  library
             will resend the same request on the new location and
             follow new Location: headers all the  way  until  no
             more such headers are returned.

     <B>CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT</B>
             A  non-zero parameter tells the library to use ASCII
             mode for  ftp  transfers,  instead  of  the  default
             binary transfer. For LDAP transfers it gets the data
             in plain text instead of HTML and for win32  systems
             it  does  not  set  the  stdout to binary mode. This
             option can be useable  when  transfering  text  data
             between system with different views on certain char­
             acters, such as newlines or similar.

     <B>CURLOPT_PUT</B>
             A non-zero parameter tells the library to  use  HTTP
             PUT  a  file.  The file to put must be set with CUR­
             LOPT_INFILE and CURLOPT_INFILESIZE.

     <B>CURLOPT_USERPWD</B>
             Pass a char * as parameter, which should  be  [user­
             name]:[password]  to  use for the connection. If the
             password is left out, you will be prompted for it.

     <B>CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD</B>
             Pass a char * as parameter, which should  be  [user­
             name]:[password]  to  use  for the connection to the
             HTTP proxy. If the password is left out, you will be
             prompted for it.

     <B>CURLOPT_RANGE</B>
             Pass a char * as parameter, which should contain the
             specified range you want. It should be in the format
             "X-Y",  where X or Y may be left out. HTTP transfers
             also support several intervals, separated with  com­
             mas as in <I>X-Y,N-M</I> response document in pieces.

     <B>CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER</B>
             Pass a char * to a buffer that the libcurl may store
             human readable error messages in. This may  be  more
             helpful  than just the return code from the library.
             The buffer must be at least CURL_ERROR_SIZE big.

     <B>CURLOPT_TIMEOUT</B>
             Pass a long as parameter containing the maximum time
             in seconds that you allow the libcurl transfer oper­
             ation to take. Normally, name  lookups  can  take  a
             considerable  time  and  limiting operations to less
             than a few minutes risk  aborting  perfectly  normal
             operations.  This  option will cause curl to use the
             SIGALRM to enable  timeouting  system  calls.   <B>NOTE</B>
             that  this does not work in multi-threaded programs!

     <B>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS</B>
             Pass a char * as parameter, which should be the full
             data  to post in a HTTP post operation. See also the
             CURLOPT_POST. Since  7.8,  using  CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS
             implies CURLOPT_POST.

     <B>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE</B>
             If  you want to post data to the server without let­
             ting libcurl do a strlen() to measure the data size,
             this  option must be used. Also, when this option is
             used, you can post fully binary data which otherwise
             is  likely to fail. If this size is set to zero, the
             library will use strlen()  to  get  the  data  size.
             (Added in libcurl 7.2)

     <B>CURLOPT_REFERER</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter. It will be used to set the referer: header  in
             the http request sent to the remote server. This can
             be used to fool servers or scripts.

     <B>CURLOPT_USERAGENT</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter.  It will be used to set the user-agent: header
             in the http request sent to the remote server.  This
             can be used to fool servers or scripts.

     <B>CURLOPT_FTPPORT</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter. It will be used to get the IP address  to  use
             for  the  ftp PORT instruction. The PORT instruction
             tells the remote server to connect to our  specified
             IP  address. The string may be a plain IP address, a
             host name, an network interface name (under unix) or
             just  a  '-' letter to let the library use your sys­
             tems default IP address.

     <B>CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT</B>
             Pass a long as parameter. It contains  the  transfer
             speed  in  bytes per second that the transfer should
             be below during CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME  seconds  for
             the library to consider it too slow and abort.

     <B>CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME</B>
             Pass  a  long  as parameter. It contains the time in
             seconds that the transfer should be below  the  CUR­
             LOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT  for the library to consider it
             too slow and abort.

     <B>CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM</B>
             Pass a long as parameter. It contains the offset  in
             number  of bytes that you want the transfer to start
             from.

     <B>CURLOPT_COOKIE</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter.  It  will  be used to set a cookie in the http
             request.  The  format  of  the  string   should   be
             [NAME]=[CONTENTS]; Where NAME is the cookie name.

     <B>CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER</B>
             Pass  a  pointer to a linked list of HTTP headers to
             pass to the server in your HTTP request. The  linked
             list  should  be  a  fully  valid  list  of  'struct
             curl_slist'  structs   properly   filled   in.   Use
             <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>append(3)</I>   to   create   the   list  and
             <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>free</I><B>_</B><I>all(3)</I> to clean up an  entire  list.
             If  you add a header that is otherwise generated and
             used by libcurl internally, your added one  will  be
             used  instead.  If you add a header with no contents
             as in 'Accept:', the  internally  used  header  will
             just  get  disabled. Thus, using this option you can
             add new headers, replace internal headers and remove
             internal headers.

     <B>CURLOPT_HTTPPOST</B>
             Tells  libcurl  you  want  a multipart/formdata HTTP
             POST to be made and you instruct what data  to  pass
             on  to  the server.  Pass a pointer to a linked list
             of HTTP post structs as parameter.  The linked  list
             should  be  a  fully valid list of 'struct HttpPost'
             structs properly filled in. The best and  most  ele­
             gant  way  to  do this, is to use <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>formadd(3)</I> as
             documented. The data  in  this  list  must  remained
             intact  until  you close this curl handle again with
             curl_easy_cleanup().

     <B>CURLOPT_SSLCERT</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter.  The  string  should  be the file name of your
             certficicate in PEM format.

     <B>CURLOPT_SSLCERTPASSWD</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter.  It  will  be used as the password required to
             use the CURLOPT_SSLCERT certificate. If the password
             is not supplied, you will be prompted for it.

     <B>CURLOPT_CRLF</B>
             Convert  unix  newlines  to  CRLF  newlines  on  FTP
             uploads.

     <B>CURLOPT_QUOTE</B>
             Pass a pointer to a linked list of FTP  commands  to
             pass  to  the  server prior to your ftp request. The
             linked list should be a fully valid list of  'struct
             curl_slist'   structs   properly   filled   in.  Use
             <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>append(3)</I> to append strings (commands) to
             the  list, and clear the entire list afterwards with
             <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>free</I><B>_</B><I>all(3)</I>

     <B>CURLOPT_POSTQUOTE</B>
             Pass a pointer to a linked list of FTP  commands  to
             pass  to the server after your ftp transfer request.
             The linked list should be  a  fully  valid  list  of
             struct  curl_slist  structs  properly  filled  in as
             described for <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>QUOTE</I>

     <B>CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER</B>
             Pass a pointer to be used to write the  header  part
             of the received data to. If you don't use a callback
             to take care of the writing, this must be a FILE  *.
             The  headers are guaranteed to be written one-by-one
             and only complete lines are written. Parsing headers
             should  be easy enough using this. See also the <I>CUR­</I>
             <I>LOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HEADERFUNCTION</I> option.

     <B>CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION</B>
             Function pointer that  should  match  the  following
             prototype:  <B>size_t</B> <B>function(</B> <B>void</B> <B>*ptr,</B> <B>size_t</B> <B>size,</B>
             <B>size_t</B> <B>nmemb,</B>  <B>void</B>  <B>*stream);</B>  This  function  gets
             called  by  libcurl  as  soon  as  there is received
             header data that needs to be written down. The func­
             tion will be called once for each header with a com­
             plete header line in each invoke. The  size  of  the
             data  pointed  to  by  <I>ptr</I>  is  <I>size</I> multiplied with
             <I>nmemb.</I>  The pointer named <I>stream</I> will be the one you
             passed   to  libcurl  with  the  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>WRITEHEADER</I>
             option.  Return the number of bytes actually written
             or return -1 to signal error to the library (it will
             cause   it   to   abort   the   transfer   with    a
             <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>WRITE</I><B>_</B><I>ERROR</I>  return  code).  (Added in libcurl
             7.7.2)

     <B>CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter.  It should contain the name of your file hold­
             ing cookie data. The cookie data may be in  Netscape
             /  Mozilla  cookie data format or just regular HTTP-
             style headers dumped to a file.

     <B>CURLOPT_SSLVERSION</B>
             Pass a long as parameter. Set what version of SSL to
             attempt  to use, 2 or 3. By default, the SSL library
             will try to  solve  this  by  itself  although  some
             servers  make  this  difficult why you at times will
             have to use this option.

     <B>CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION</B>
             Pass a long as parameter. This defines how the  CUR­
             LOPT_TIMEVALUE  time  value  is treated. You can set
             this  parameter  to  TIMECOND_IFMODSINCE  or   TIME­
             COND_IFUNMODSINCE.  This  is  aa  HTTP-only feature.
             (TBD)

     <B>CURLOPT_TIMEVALUE</B>
             Pass a long as parameter. This should be the time in
             seconds  since 1 jan 1970, and the time will be used
             as specified in  CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION  or  if  that
             isn't   used,  it  will  be  TIMECOND_IFMODSINCE  by
             default.

     <B>CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST</B>
             Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as param­
             eter.  It  will  be user instead of GET or HEAD when
             doing the HTTP request. This  is  useful  for  doing
             DELETE or other more obscure HTTP requests. Don't do
             this at will, make sure  your  server  supports  the
             command first.

     <B>CURLOPT_STDERR</B>
             Pass  a  FILE  * as parameter. This is the stream to
             use instead  of  stderr  internally  when  reporting
             errors.

     <B>CURLOPT_INTERFACE</B>
             Pass  a  char * as parameter. This set the interface
             name to use as outgoing network interface. The  name
             can  be  an  interface name, an IP address or a host
             name. (Added in libcurl 7.3)

     <B>CURLOPT_KRB4LEVEL</B>
             Pass a char * as parameter. Set  the  krb4  security
             level,  this also enables krb4 awareness.  This is a
             string, 'clear',  'safe',  'confidential'  or  'pri­
             vate'.   If  the string is set but doesn't match one
             of these, 'private' will be used. Set the string  to
             NULL to disable kerberos4. The kerberos support only
             works for FTP. (Added in libcurl 7.3)

     <B>CURLOPT_WRITEINFO</B>
             (NOT PRESENT IN 7.4 or later!)  Pass a pointer to  a
             zero terminated string as parameter. It will be used
             to report information after  a  successful  request.
             This  string may contain variables that will be sub­
             stituted by their contents  when  output.  Described
             elsewhere.

     <B>CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION</B>
             Function    pointer    that    should    match   the
             <B>curl_progress_callback</B>    prototype     found     in
             <I>&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</I>  This  function gets called by libcurl
             instead of its internal  equivalent.  Unknown/unused
             argument  values  will  be  set to zero (like if you
             only download data, the upload size will remain  0).
             Returning  a  non-zero value from this callback will
             cause libcurl  to  abort  the  transfer  and  return
             CURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK.

     <B>CURLOPT_PROGRESSDATA</B>
             Pass a pointer that will be untouched by libcurl and
             passed as the first argument in the  progress  call­
             back set with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PROGRESSFUNCTION</I>
              .

     <B>CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER</B>
             Pass  a long that is set to a non-zero value to make
             curl verify the peer's certificate. The  certificate
             to  verify  against  must be specified with the CUR­
             LOPT_CAINFO option. (Added in 7.4.2)

     <B>CURLOPT_CAINFO</B>
             Pass a char * to a zero terminated file naming hold­
             ing  the  certificate  to verify the peer with. This
             only makes sense when used in combination  with  the
             CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER option. (Added in 7.4.2)

     <B>CURLOPT_PASSWDFUNCTION</B>
             Pass  a  pointer  to a curl_passwd_callback function
             that will then be called instead of the internal one
             if  libcurl  requests  a password. The function must
             match this prototype: <B>int</B>  <B>my_getpass(void</B>  <B>*client,</B>
             <B>char</B>  <B>*prompt,</B> <B>char*</B> <B>buffer,</B> <B>int</B> <B>buflen</B> <B>);</B> If set to
             NULL, it equals to making the function always  fail.
             If  the  function  returns a non-zero value, it will
             abort the operation and  an  error  (CURLE_BAD_PASS­
             WORD_ENTERED) will be returned.  <I>client</I> is a generic
             pointer, see CURLOPT_PASSWDDATA.  <I>prompt</I> is a  zero-
             terminated  string  that  is  text that prefixes the
             input request.  <I>buffer</I> is a pointer  to  data  where
             the  entered password should be stored and <I>buflen</I> is
             the maximum number of bytes that may be  written  in
             the buffer.  (Added in 7.4.2)

     <B>CURLOPT_PASSWDDATA</B>
             Pass  a void * to whatever data you want. The passed
             pointer will be  the  first  argument  sent  to  the
             specifed  CURLOPT_PASSWDFUNCTION function. (Added in
             7.4.2)

     <B>CURLOPT_FILETIME</B>
             Pass a long. If it is a non-zero value, libcurl will
             attempt  to  get the modification date of the remote
             document in this operation. This requires  that  the
             remote  server  sends  the time or replies to a time
             querying command. The  curl_easy_getinfo()  function
             with  the  CURLINFO_FILETIME  argument  can  be used
             after a transfer to extract the  received  time  (if
             any). (Added in 7.5)

     <B>CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS</B>
             Pass  a long. The set number will be the redirection
             limit. If that many redirections have been followed,
             the  next  redirect will cause an error. This option
             only makes sense if  the  CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION  is
             used at the same time. (Added in 7.5)

     <B>CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS</B>
             Pass  a  long. The set number will be the persistant
             connection cache size. The set amount  will  be  the
             maximum  amount  of  simultaneous  connections  that
             libcurl may cache between file transfers. Default is
             5, and there isn't much point in changing this value
             unless you are perfectly aware of how this work  and
             changes  libcurl's  behaviour.  Note:  if  you  have
             already performed transfers with this  curl  handle,
             setting  a smaller MAXCONNECTS than before may cause
             open connections to unnecessarily get closed. (Added
             in 7.7)

     <B>CURLOPT_CLOSEPOLICY</B>
             Pass  a  long.  This option sets what policy libcurl
             should use when the connection cache is  filled  and
             one of the open connections has to be closed to make
             room for a new connection. This must be one  of  the
             CURLCLOSEPOLICY_*    defines.    Use   CURLCLOSEPOL­
             ICY_LEAST_RECENTLY_USED to make  libcurl  close  the
             connection  that  was least recently used, that con­
             nection is also least likely to be  capable  of  re-
             use.  Use  CURLCLOSEPOLICY_OLDEST  to  make  libcurl
             close the oldest connection, the one that  was  cre­
             ated  first  among the ones in the connection cache.
             The other close policies are not support yet. (Added
             in 7.7)

     <B>CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT</B>
             Pass a long. Set to non-zero to make the next trans­
             fer use a new connection by force. If the connection
             cache  is  full  before  this connection, one of the
             existinf connections will be closed as according  to
             the set policy. This option should be used with cau­
             tion and only if you understand what it does. Set to
             0 to have libcurl attempt re-use of an existing con­
             nection.  (Added in 7.7)

     <B>CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE</B>
             Pass a long. Set to non-zero to make the next trans­
             fer  explicitly close the connection when done. Nor­
             mally, libcurl keep all connections alive when  done
             with  one  transfer in case there comes a succeeding
             one that can re-use them.   This  option  should  be
             used with caution and only if you understand what it
             does. Set to 0 to have libcurl keep  the  connection
             open for possibly later re-use. (Added in 7.7)

     <B>CURLOPT_RANDOM_FILE</B>
             Pass  a  char  * to a zero terminated file name. The
             file will be used to read from to  seed  the  random
             engine  for  SSL. The more random the specified file
             is, the more secure will the SSL connection  become.

     <B>CURLOPT_EGDSOCKET</B>
             Pass  a  char  * to the zero terminated path name to
             the Entropy Gathering Daemon socket. It will be used
             to seed the random engine for SSL.

     <B>CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT</B>
             Pass  a  long. It should contain the maximum time in
             seconds that you allow the connection to the  server
             to  take.   This  only  limits the connection phase,
             once it has connected, this option  is  of  no  more
             use.  Set  to zero to disable connection timeout (it
             will then only  timeout  on  the  system's  internal
             timeouts).  See  also  the  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>TIMEOUT</I>  option.
             <B>NOTE</B> that this does not work in multi-threaded  pro­
             grams!

     <B>CURLOPT_HTTPGET</B>
             Pass  a  long.  If the long is non-zero, this forces
             the HTTP request to get back  to  GET.  Only  really
             usable  if  POST,  PUT or a custom request have been
             used previously using the same curl  handle.  (Added
             in 7.8.1)

     <B>CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST</B>
             Pass a long. Set if we should verify the Common name
             from the peer certificate in the SSL handshake,  set
             1  to  check  existence, 2 to ensure that it matches
             the provided hostname. (Added in 7.8.1)

     <B>CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR</B>
             Pass a file name as char *,  zero  terminated.  This
             will  make libcurl dump all internally known cookies
             to the specified file  when  curl_easy_cleanup()  is
             called.  If  no  cookies  are known, no file will be
             created. Specify "-" to  instead  have  the  cookies
             written to stdout.

     <B>CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST</B>
             Pass  a char *, pointing to a zero terminated string
             holding the list of ciphers to use for the SSL  con­
             nection. The list must be syntactly correct, it con­
             sists of one or more  cipher  strings  separated  by
             colons. Commas or spaces are also acceptable separa­
             tors but colons are normally used, , - and + can  be
             used  as  operators.  Valid examples of cipher lists
             include   'RC4-SHA',   ´SHA1+DES´,    'TLSv1'    and
             'DEFAULT'. The default list is normally set when you
             compile OpenSSL.

             You'll find all details about cipher lists  on  this
             URL: <I>http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</I>
