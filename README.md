    3D Mail Effects - Installation Readme File

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    3D Mail Effects is a very unique email notification program/agent with as much
    style as it has functionality. 3D Mail Effects is completely skinnable. When you
    get new mail, you get a realistic, rotating 3D object that appears floating on
    your desktop! Preview & delete emails without having to load your email program,
    unlimited number of POP3 accounts (each individually configurable with their own
    alarms, timers, etc.), hides nicely in the tray (blinks with new mail) and will
    flash your keyboard LEDs so you can see when new mail has arrived without
    turning on your monitor. 3D Mail Effects is completely configurable, not only
    is the app skinned, but so are the 3D objects!

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Installation instructions:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Simply run SETUP.EXE and follow the prompts.

Because history matters. This code is a snapshot of how things were done back then—and in some cases, how they’re still done today. Think of it as open source time travel.
